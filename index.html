<sdiv class="About">

<div class="paragraphs">
  <p> Hello World! Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Luv. I am an artist who loves art and music. I am
    sharing my class work with you. I am so grateful to be learning coding I want to be successful at this and grow in
    this market.</p>
    <br>
    </br>
    <p>This has not been an easy class for me. I am trying everyday to be better at this. I think it is important to
    understand the work that you are doing rather than how it looks. First, learn why you are using a certain if
    statment or function. If you do not understand the code, do not write it until you understand it. Once you understand the code,
    then you should focus on the design. I am being patient with myself because there is a lot of information to be
    have to absorbed. My work is not perfect, but it will eventually get better. I thank you for visiting my site and I
    am looking forward to everyone visting my site again.
  </p>

          <p> This was a group project that I had a lot of fun working on.  We created a music forum where music lovers can talk about their favorite artist or group.  The users can create, edit and delete post and comment on other post.</p>

        <p> In this assignment you can look for an employee, edit and employee, view the employee's manager and see what department the employee works in. This is the perfect form for human resources to keep track of the employees who work for them.  They would be able to view and change their salaries.</p>
